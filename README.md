# biodaten24-25-large_bulk_multiomics

## Project Overview

This project is based on bulk ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data from COVID-19 patient samples from the NAPKON-Project [https://napkon.de/]. 



## Project Structure
This project is divided into four **Work Packages (WPs)**, each responsible for a different aspect of the analysis:

#### WP1 - 

#### WP2 - 

#### WP3 - Quality Control
WP3 is responsible for assessing the quality of bulk ATAC-seq data using QC metrics.

This Workflow includes the conversion from BAM to BED, the Quality Control with PeakQC [https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.02.20.639146v1.full] and the Metric Evaluation.

#### WP4 - 

## Workflow Overview
The following diagram illustrates the general workflow and how the different WPs are interconnected:
